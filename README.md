# Pikachu Drawing with Turtle Graphics

This project creates a graphical representation of Pikachu, the iconic Pok√©mon character, using Python's Turtle Graphics. The script allows users to visualize the creation of Pikachu's various elements such as the eyes, mouth, cheeks, ears, body, and tail. It employs object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate the drawing logic and provides an interactive drawing experience.


## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: You can click and drag the turtle to move it around, allowing you to interact with the drawing.
- **Modular Design**: The project uses object-oriented design to structure the code, making it easier to understand and modify.
- **Detailed Pikachu Drawing**: The project includes intricate details like eyes, cheeks, mouth, ears, body, and tail, replicating Pikachu's appearance.

## How It Works

- The `Pikachu` class encapsulates all the drawing logic.
- The `noTrace_goto` method allows the turtle to move without leaving a trace.
- Various methods like `leftEye`, `rightEye`, `mouth`, `leftCheek`, and `rightCheek` are used to draw specific parts of Pikachu.
- The `body` method creates the complete outline and details of Pikachu's body.
- The `start` method initiates the drawing process.
